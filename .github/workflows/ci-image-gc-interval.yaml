# cleaner for ghcr image , each day
# NOTE: at now only orgs is supported , for personal it fail
# This action uses the Github Rest API deletePackageVersionForOrg() resource which states:
# To use this endpoint, you must have admin permissions in the organization and authenticate using an access token with the packages:read and packages:delete scopes. In addition: [...] If package_type is container, you must also have admin permissions to the container you want to delete.
#  As a result, for this action to work, the token must be associated to a user who has admin permissions for both the organization and the package. If this is not the case, then dry-runs will work as expected but actual runs will fail with a Package not found error when attempting to delete versions.
